# Boogio Hello World Example App
An iOS example app project which connects to Boogio.

Data are displayed as labels and can be exported as CSV file email attachments.

A settings view controller is also included, demonstrating how to scan for and save device UUIDs.

This project uses a BoogioPeripheralNetworkManager framework which is still in development but significantly reduces the complexity of this project. As it nears completion, the framework source will be made freely available.
