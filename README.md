# Boogio Hello World Example App
An iOS example app project which connects to Boogio.

Data are displayed as labels and can be exported as CSV file email attachments.

A settings view controller is also included, demonstrating how to scan for and save device UUIDs.

This project uses a BoogioPeripheralNetworkManager framework which is still in development but significantly reduces the complexity of this project. As it nears completion, the framework source will be made freely available. 

This project is not capable of building or running from the simulator. An iPhone 6 or later is recommended.
